# 📡 Nearfield Data Communication

## 📌 Description

**Nearfield Data Communication** is a project focused on enabling secure, contactless data exchange using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. NFC allows short-range wireless communication between devices, making it ideal for smart systems like access control, digital ticketing, mobile payments, and identity verification.

This project demonstrates:

- 📥 Reading data from NFC cards and tags  
- ✍️ Writing data to NFC cards and tags  
- 🔐 Encrypting and decrypting sensitive information stored on NFC mediums  

It showcases how NFC technology can be integrated with microcontrollers to develop real-world applications where security, speed, and user-friendliness are essential. Whether you're working on a smart ticketing system, authentication module, or a simple digital handshake between devices, this project serves as a foundation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect the **PN532 NFC Module** to **Arduino Nano** using jumper wires.
- Use **I2C or SPI** connection (based on your PN532 module version).
- Insert the setup into a breadboard for easy wiring and testing.

### 2. Software Setup
- Open the **Arduino IDE** and install the **Adafruit PN532 library** via the Library Manager.
- Upload the provided sketch to your Arduino Nano.
- Open the **Serial Monitor** at **9600 baud** to view the communication logs.

### 3. Usage
- Bring an NFC tag or card close to the PN532 module.
- The system will **read or write** the data, depending on the programmed functionality.
- Optional encryption logic can be used to **secure data** stored on the tag.
